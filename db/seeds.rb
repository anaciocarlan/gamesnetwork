It's simple in its design – cute, colorful sprites – and it wasn't too different from the GBA versions, but Advance Wars: Dual Strike has a fantastic challenging single player campaign and is still to this day one of the best multiplayer experiences on the DS. It was also one of the first games to show off the Nintendo DS system's wireless capabilities, which when coming from link cables was a godsend.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e8/Advance_Wars_DS_cover_art.jpg"},

What started as an open-world survival horror game eventually evolved into a linear, creepy experience that was tightly paced from start to finish. Utilizing an engaging light and darkness system, Alan Wake was polished, interesting, and terrifying throughout. No matter how dark the woods of the Pacific Northwest got, the visuals in Alan Wake’s world were beautiful and haunting. As a console exclusive, the only setback Alan Wake suffers is that more people weren’t able to play it.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Alan_Wake_Game_Cover.jpg"},

And yet, that’s exactly what happened. Maybe it’s the funny art style or the “just one more level” type of gameplay, but this puzzle/action hybrid successfully struck a chord with mobile gamers across the world. The basic idea is that you fling different types of birds (each with different abilities) at these evil pig dudes. Crush them all and destroy their hangout to win. It might sound silly, but chances are you won’t be able to stop yourself until you’ve gotten three gold stars in every level.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Angry_Birds_promo_art.png"},

Roaming around 15th century Italy as you try to find your way or stake out your next target is quite immersive, and Eagle Vision is easier to use than ever. With gameplay that does an amazing job of making you feel connected to the city, and a multitude of ways to go about conquering this open-world adventure, ACII is a layered and enjoyable experience with excellent visuals to back it up.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.JPG"},

From the free flow combat system to the brilliant voice work to the excellent characterization of Gotham’s fiercest baddies, Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece. Little details like the Dark Knight’s arsenal of gadgets, the Joker’s running commentary, and the Riddler’s growing frustration as you solve his hidden riddles all add to what is a fully immersive and downright unforgettable experience. If you’ve ever loved Batman, comics, or even just action games in general, you owe it to yourself to own this game.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Batman_Arkham_Asylum_Videogame_Cover.jpg"},

EA and DICE made sure this wasn’t the case with Bad Company 2, adding a lengthy, fun campaign with a likable cast of characters that took full advantage of the Frostbite engine’s ability to blow stuff up real good. Of course, the long-term draw of Bad Company 2 was and remains its fantastic multiplayer. While the environmental destruction is fun, it’s the class-based dynamics that really shine – they make Bad Company 2 one of the few online shooters that lets you succeed in ways that don’t involve shooting things.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/Battlefield_Bad_Company_2_cover.jpg"},

That series is Bionic Commando. Released in the arcade in 1987, on the NES in 1988, and on the Game Boy in 1992, Bionic Commando was long-dormant until 2008, when Bionic Commando Rearmed came to downloadable services across the platforms. What gamers found was an updated 2D side-scrolling action title experience still mired in the grueling conventions of Bionic Commando’s original difficulty level. For instance, platforming is limited because you can’t jump, instead having to use a bionic arm to cross chasms. But the old-school wouldn’t have it any other way.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/BionicCommandoRearmedcover.jpg"},

The thumping feet of a Big Daddy, the glowing eyes of a Little Sister, the retro music and the festive masks of the splicers all combined with the decaying world to create a chilling atmosphere that served as the backdrop for one of gaming’s greatest stories. Playing as an anonymous character, you were forced to discover the story of the city and yourself as went deeper into Rapture. The combination of powers with traditional weapons made the gameplay experience unique and customizable to each individual, making it appear to a wide range of players.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/BioShock_cover.jpg"},

You not only get hour after hour of bullet-spraying gameplay, but also an abundance of loot to collect. The story may not have been all that entertaining, but exploring the environments and doing quest after quest was always worth it to find the next shiny item, or to get that last little bit of experience needed to level up. Best of all, though, was the four-player coop through the entire campaign.

But even though it relies on this tried and true premise, don’t be fooled: Braid is a unique game that adds some interesting new elements to the platforming genre. Its main gimmick is time manipulation, allowing you to actually go back in time and undo any of your actions. Throw in dopplegangers and puzzle pieces you must collect to progress, and you’ve got a challenging (albeit far too short) and interesting take on the puzzle/platforming genre.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6a/Braidlogo.jpg"},

But none of them ever compared to Brain Age. Using the touch screen players completed various puzzles ranging from math to yelling the word blue repeatedly. It was simple, it was soothing, and it got your brain more active. Whether that was actually as beneficial as it claimed is up to debate, but it got millions of people to do math problems willingly, so that's something pretty amazing.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ef/NDS_BrainTrainingForAdults.jpg"},

But with the release of Paradise, the one-race-at-a-time-chaos turned into an open world experience where the crashes, speed, and chaos were found on every street corner in Paradise City. With more events than you could count, and a fantastic roster of cars to race, this world featured exactly what the title promised. For the first time in the series, Paradise introduced bikes through DLC, which were a joy to cruise through the city on. Burnout: Paradise took every cool and exciting element of the Burnout name and applied a simple formula to it: more.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/Burnout_Paradise_Boxart_2.jpg"},

World War II and futuristic sci-fi settings had been visited again and again. Many fans of the genre were wondering if any developer could find fresh ground to explore. Then came Infinity Ward and Modern Warfare. Just as it did with Call of Duty 2, the folks at IW found a way to breathe new life into something that seemed like it was barely scraping by. Whether it was the captivating story, the superb online component or the refined, precise control scheme, the fourth Call of Duty captured gamers in a way few games this generation have. What’s more remarkable is how one game reignited an entire genre, paving the way for countless imitators and yearly sequels.

With an adorable art-style and four-player cooperative play, Castle Crashers stole our hearts. Despite its brutal difficulty, it’s simply too fun to swing away at enemies for hours on end, leveling up the heroes and grinding away at the same stages over and over. It may not be all that original in its design, but it’s the perfect party game; a great way to spend an evening even years after its release. When people look back at this generation, Castle Crashers will be one of the few titles they consider timeless.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/Castle_Crashers_cover.jpg"},

It didn’t take the series to new heights, but rather built on the solid foundation established by the Castlevania games on the Game Boy Advance. Beautiful and great fun, Dawn of Sorrow wisely avoided the touch screen gimmicks of other early DS games. Everything you would want from a Symphony of the Night-style Castlevania game -- platforming, puzzles, boss fights, exploration -- is here in excellent condition. Dawn of Sorrow was worth buying a DS for.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/50/Castlevania_-_Dawn_of_Sorrow_Coverart.png"},

Rather than focus on base-building or resource-collecting, those standard RTS aspects were blended into, and wholly reliant on, the movement of your troops. Implementing a cover system, where units could use structures and rubble to gain defensive and offensive bonuses, further emphasized the importance of troop micromanagement. All of this was finely tuned and balanced, resulting in an exhilarating and popular multiplayer meta-game.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/Companyofheroes_pcboxboxart_160w.jpg"},

It had to go and create a game engine that's still bringing gaming PCs to their knees more than four years later. Crysis allowed an almost unprecedented level of freedom of movement in a PC FPS, and it complemented it with great physics and an involved weapon customization system that let players tackle the world the way they wanted to - or they could go down to a beautiful beach and skip crabs and turtles off the water.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Crysis_Cover.jpg"},

The crux of the gameplay is just that -- slicing a rope (or multiple ropes) so that a cute dinosaur gets to chow on some candy. Who could have guessed that such a simple premise would make for one of the addictive games on iOS, though? It may not have a deep story or do more to promote the idea that mobile games are \"real\" games, but it's undoubtedly responsible for making a slew of new gamers.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Cut_the_Rope_logo.png"},

Then, months later, Dead Rising came out. It packed environments with dozens of zombies on the screen, it gave you the chance to slice the undead in half with a katana, and you could even take erotic photos. Yes, the story of photojournalist Frank West and his quest to uncover the zombie scoop hooked fans, but it was the costumes, replayability, and zany ways to mow down the ghouls that kept them around and truly showcased what the Xbox 360 could do.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Deadrising_boxart.jpg"},

Visceral changed all of that with Dead Space, a System Shock-influenced journey through the bowels of an industrial hell. The term “tour-de-force” is over-used, but in Dead Space’s case, it’s barely adequate. Dead Space combines a bombastic, gothic score with some of the most frightening creature design this side of H. R. Giger’s Alien to create a game that made players uncomfortable enough to take breaks – but without resorting to dated limitations like aiming-in-place. Oh, and that ending?

FromSoftware created one of the most difficult, but fair, action titles this generation has ever seen with Demon’s Souls. The story boils down to you, the hero, having to vanquish demons that inhabit the medieval world of Boletaria.  The twist with Demon’s Souls is that when you die -- and you will die a lot -- the game gets even harder. Oh, players can also invade your world at any time to try and kill you online. Scared? Good.

The original mixes created for this party game were stunning and scratching the turntable peripheral was just as fun as it looked. DJ Hero wasn’t as full-featured as Rock Band 2 or Guitar Hero 5, but the simpler presentation really worked in its favor -- without any world tour to distract us we could focus on the amazing music that, unfortunately, still can’t be found anywhere else.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/Dj-hero-cover.jpg"},

Donkey Kong Country Returns managed to capture the feeling of the SNES classics, a series we had been missing for over a decade now. Retro Studios proved their 2D chops with the game, bringing Donkey Kong into the current generation with a game that was challenging, exciting, and innovative. The co-op play was way more than a \"girlfriend mode\" and the end of the game was so difficult it made us finally feel like we were playing a legit Nintendo game on the Wii.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Donkeykongcountryreturns.jpg"},

Dragons (duh), elves, dwarves, magic and swords -- Dragon Age has it all. For BioWare fans, the game provided a much-awaited bridge to the developer’s famous fantasy franchise, Baulder’s Gate. Dragon Age’s lore surrounded an Archdemon and its Darkspawn underlings, but the gameplay on the PC was very reminiscent of Baldur’s Gate. While the slower-paced, tactical combat didn’t translate well to consoles, PC players were able to enjoy a well-polished adventure. Saving the world is pretty clichйd, but Dragon Age managed to tell a tale that felt fresh and your decisions along the way impacted what groups stood by your side at the end.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Dragon_Age_Origins_cover.png"},

Released on PC and Xbox 360 in 2006 and a year later on the PlayStation 3, Oblivion brought gamers to the fictional province of Cyrodiil, tasking them to complete a meaty main quest while complimenting that quest with incredible freedom to explore the territory at will.

The mucical rhythm game spawned a number of rip-offs and copy cats, but nothing ever compared to the wacky, hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking presentation and music of Elite Beat Agents. Tapping, swirling and sliding on the touch screen is fun, even while listening to Avril Lavigne.

This is a game where players can earn townsfolk’s respect or hatred by performing a combination of actions like farting, dancing and growling. With a mix of tasks like working a blacksmithing job to heroic quests like saving the kingdom of Albion, Fable II was a wonderfully addictive game. Part of the fun was the freedom to explore Albion’s different regions like the civilized Bowerstone that’s patrolled by guards or the free-for-all town of Bloodstone where you can literally get away with murder.

New Marias was more varied with flooded areas and lively people, the enemies were bigger, and the two endings were so different it's hard to imagine where the series goes from here.

It's one of the rare games that can be just as entertaining to watch as it is to play. Continuing the tradition of lightning fast, real-time strategy, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty boasted a massive single-player campaign that followed the story of James Raynor and his efforts to free Kerrigan from Zerg control. Besides this story, an incredible multiplayer suite was included in StarCraft II giving players access to all three warring races. This multiplayer was nearly unmatched in depth and usability, and it ensured the gaming populace that StarCraft II will be around for years to come.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/StarCraft_II_-_Box_Art.jpg"},

Yet Nintendo’s team in Tokyo felt it was up to the task, attempting to capture lightning in a bottle twice. Shockingly, they did. Though the first Galaxy was certainly more innovative, its successor took that spectacular gameplay and refined it, besting its previous efforts. Every level in Galaxy 2 felt like it could be the foundation for an entire game. The creativity on display here is almost unparalleled. In an industry full of iterative sequels, few are worthwhile. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is certainly one of the worthy.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Super_Mario_Galaxy_2_Box_Art.jpg"},

Super Paper Mario married traditional run-and-jump Mario platformer gameplay with the flattened, 2D visual style of his most recent console RPGs to create an incredible hybrid. As if that weren’t enough, it then spun this whole idea on its head, enabling you to flip each 2D environment around into the third dimension. With our minds as blown as they were back in 2007, it's a wonder we're still around to tell you about it today.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c9/Super_Paper_Mario_cover.jpg"},

Brawl pulled together iconic mascots from every single notable Nintendo franchise, some not-so-notable ones and even a couple outside companies and threw them at each other in a frantic, free-for-all fighting design. Brawl built on the massive momentum already achieved by the first two Smash Bros. titles and worked Big N fans into a frenzy even before it released to stores -- and now, years later, those fans are still setting up tournaments, debating its merits versus those of its GameCube predecessor and arguing \"items/no items\" late into the night.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/SSBB_Cover.jpg"},

During the PlayStation Network's infancy, one game followed in the footsteps of Geometry Wars and, in some ways, surpassed it. That game was Super Stardust HD. Developed by the folks at Finnish studio Housemarque, Super Stardust HD was a stunning shooter with enough visual pizzazz to kill a man. Controlling an enormously powerful spaceship and cutting through waves of asteroids was never easier, and the action was punctuated with a soundtrack that would fit perfectly in a sweaty, neon-powered geek rave. In short: Super Stardust HD was shooter perfection.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Psn_super_stardust_hd_icon.png"},

With a vivid art style and lightning fast combat, Street Fighter IV entered the competitive gaming scene already ahead of the pack. Super Street Fighter IV, which launched more than a year later, built on that wild success and added several new characters to an already razor-sharp roster. It also addressed the usual issues of balancing characters out for a complex, tournament-grade experience.

This point-and-click adventure is a near-perfect polyamorous marriage of brilliant 8-bit visuals, clever puzzle-solving, and an unforgettable soundtrack. Plus, Sword & Sworcery actually uses the lunar cycle to unlock the last two game events. Sure, it’s a little artsy-fartsy, but there is a good adventure here to back up the experimentation. The core game is a fantastic throwback to classic PC software. It’s a must-have game on both iPad and iPhone.

On consoles, the shooter grew stagnant, but on PC, Valve provided (and as of writing, still provides) endless support. Today's TF2 hardly resembles the original, with RPG-style item drops, a loot shop, and dozens of hats.

Strangely enough, though, Nintendo only released a relatively small amount of copies of Tetris for the DS. It quickly became recognized as one of the best versions of the iconic puzzler, especially since it offered four-player competitive play off a single cartridge. It’s still as addictive as ever today, and is even better if you manage to jump online and take on a player on the other side of the world.

It was a marketing move that worked, as the result was an adventure that not only let us return to explore the land of Hyrule but also introduced the unique abilities of the Wii's new Remote -- pointing at the screen to fire arrows and physically swinging our wrists to slash Link's sword set this quest apart. Despite a few flaws, Twilight Princess captured a scope and story maturity that all Zelda fans were dying to experience, raising the bar for future releases, portable or otherwise.", picture: "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_Twilight_Princess_Game_Cover.jpg"},

The Witcher 2 isn’t just one of the best role-playing games of 2011, but one of the best in years. It combines a depth of combat, strength of setting and quality of writing to great effect, delivering a vivid, textured fantasy world that’s easy to get lost in. What’s even more impressive is the quest design. No task feels pointless, and the choices made can have big implications on the path of the main story.

In Tiny Wings, the player takes control of a bird whose wings are too small to fly. The goal of the game is to use hills in order to gain speed and flutter as long as possible. This is done by tapping and holding the screen in order to make the bird dive. The game play mainly revolves around timing your taps so that the bird slides down hills and flies up them. The game features special missions to upgrade the player's nest and increase their score multiplier. These challenges revolve around reaching specific islands or achieving certain feats a number of times in one game. The game's visuals are procedurally generated, making it look different every day.

Despite being slower-paced than many other shooters, playing through sprawling levels set in Las Vegas landmarks makes for a thrilling experience. Whether you prefer close-quarters combat or sniping for headshots, Vegas’ many weapons and tools let you take the enemy out your way. This is also one of the first great cooperative experiences of this generation, allowing up to four operatives to sneak around together online.

With an overwhelming number of options to play alone or with others, there’s something here for every kind of strategy fan.

Uncharted 2: Among Thieves brought back what fans expected -- jaw-dropping graphics, a monumental musical score, and plenty of climbing mixed with gunplay – and then added multiplayer. Many scoffed when the idea was introduced and worried that the single-player quality would dip, but the fears were unfounded.

A lush garden required intense micro-managing skills – plucking weeds, dealing with the aftermath of the evil Professor Pester and his crew of Ruffians (who like to kill piсatas and plants) and developing an alluring environment for piсatas.

The tactics-focused, cover-based gameplay of Company of Heroes remained, but now the squads you controlled could level up, characters learned new abilities and you could alter their stats, and your foes dropped gear to augment those stats even further. There was even a free-form portion of the game where, rather than follow the central storyline, you could fight off invading aliens on different maps.
