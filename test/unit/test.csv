150,Advance Wars: Dual Strike ,2005,Nintendo,Nintendo DS,Turn-Based Strategy,"When it comes to real time strategy games, no handheld game really compares to the Advance Wars series. It's simple in its design – cute, colorful sprites – and it wasn't too different from the GBA versions, but Advance Wars: Dual Strike has a fantastic challenging single player campaign and is still to this day one of the best multiplayer experiences on the DS. It was also one of the first games to show off the Nintendo DS system's wireless capabilities, which when coming from link cables was a godsend.",http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e8/Advance_Wars_DS_cover_art.jpg
200,Alan Wake ,2010,Microsoft Game Studios,"Windows, Xbox 360",Survival Horror,"Alan Wake hid in the dark night of development for years before finally breaking out of the woods and finding a retail release. What started as an open-world survival horror game eventually evolved into a linear, creepy experience that was tightly paced from start to finish. Utilizing an engaging light and darkness system, Alan Wake was polished, interesting, and terrifying throughout. No matter how dark the woods of the Pacific Northwest got, the visuals in Alan Wake’s world were beautiful and haunting. As a console exclusive, the only setback Alan Wake suffers is that more people weren’t able to play it.",http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Alan_Wake_Game_Cover.jpg
300,Angry Birds ,2009,Chillingo,iOS,Puzzle,"Who knew when this iPhone app first hit the digital download scene that these inexplicably angry birds would soon take over the world? And yet, that’s exactly what happened. Maybe it’s the funny art style or the “just one more level” type of gameplay, but this puzzle/action hybrid successfully struck a chord with mobile gamers across the world. The basic idea is that you fling different types of birds (each with different abilities) at these evil pig dudes. Crush them all and destroy their hangout to win. It might sound silly, but chances are you won’t be able to stop yourself until you’ve gotten three gold stars in every level.",http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Angry_Birds_promo_art.png
400,Assassin's Creed II ,2009,Ubisoft,"Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, OS X",Action-Adventure,"Improving greatly on the original game’s design, Assassin’s Creed II is when the franchise really kicked into high gear. Roaming around 15th century Italy as you try to find your way or stake out your next target is quite immersive, and Eagle Vision is easier to use than ever. With gameplay that does an amazing job of making you feel connected to the city, and a multitude of ways to go about conquering this open-world adventure, ACII is a layered and enjoyable experience with excellent visuals to back it up.",http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/Assassins_Creed_2_Box_Art.JPG
500,Batman: Arkham Asylum ,2009,Eidos Interactive,"Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, OS X",Action-Adventure,"Batman: Arkham Asylum isn’t just an amazing action game, it’s arguably the greatest comic book game ever. From the free flow combat system to the brilliant voice work to the excellent characterization of Gotham’s fiercest baddies, Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece. Little details like the Dark Knight’s arsenal of gadgets, the Joker’s running commentary, and the Riddler’s growing frustration as you solve his hidden riddles all add to what is a fully immersive and downright unforgettable experience. If you’ve ever loved Batman, comics, or even just action games in general, you owe it to yourself to own this game.",http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Batman_Arkham_Asylum_Videogame_Cover.jpg
